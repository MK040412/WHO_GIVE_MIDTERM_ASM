# **Notice!!**

## I'm CSE student, not a EE student.  
## Thus I did only code subject, not a design circuit.  
## THX for grace to give this exam, it is pleasure on my boring day.

# WHY I'm doing this ASM assignmnet
-----------------------------------
-  Someone who is in the K-Univ asked me "Can you do a assembly code?".
-  And I said "IDK about that", then he said "Oh, then try this"
-  That's why I am doing this assignment, and It gives me a joy on a boring day.
-  It is maden by the most generous person in korea. 
-  THX for Grace on this assignment. 

## What you have to know
-----------------------------------
  * You have to know about RISC-V and Mips. Actually You have to know about RISC-V only.
  * But I love to code with MIPs. Thus I made MIPs version too 

## Reference
-----------------------------------
  * Robert L. Britton, MIPS Assmbly Language Programming
  * Patterson, David A. , Hennessy, John L, Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, MIPS Edition, 6/Ed

## Notice
-----------------------------------
  * The answer about each problem is on the each repository of the file.
  * I give description on the each repository, but you wonder about the code operation, whilde there is annotation on the code.
  * Thus I made briefly description on the problem.
  * Don't worry about the score on the problem, because I'm perfact.
* But You can wonder it is right or not, then test this code.
